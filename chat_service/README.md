## ABOUT
This project is only for demonstration purposes, and for simplicity, 
I have already omitted tests, Swagger, sharding, etc. in this service. 
Please refer for the tests and Swagger in Golang for the user_service service, 
and for sharding + write/read database separation in Java in this project:
